Homage to the buddhas and bodhisattvas!

Chapter 1 — The Benefits of Bodhicitta

With devotion I pay homage to the buddhas gone to bliss,To their Dharma body, noble heirs and
all worthy of respect.In accordance with the scriptures, I shall now in brief describeThe
way to adopt the discipline of all the buddhas’ heirs.There is nothing here that’s not been
said before;And I have no skill in the art of composition.Therefore I do not expect this
to be of much use to others,And write it only to acquaint it to my mind.Through this, my
faith will be strengthened for a while,And I will grow more accustomed to what is virtuous.Then
should others, somehow equal to myself in fortune,Chance upon these words, they might
find them beneficial.This free and well-favoured human form is difficult to obtain.Now
that we have the chance to realise the full human potential,If we don’t make good use of
this opportunity,How could we possibly expect to have such a chance again?Like a flash of
lightning on a dark and cloudy night,Which, for just a single instant, sheds its brilliant
light,Rarely, through the buddhas’ power,A mind of virtue arises, briefly, to people of the
world.  All ordinary virtues therefore are forever feeble,Whilst negativity is strong and
difficult to bear—But for the mind intent on perfect buddhahood,What other virtue could
ever overcome it?Contemplating wisely throughout the ages,The mighty buddhas have seen its
great benefit:That it helps the boundless multitude of beingsEasily to gain the highest
states of bliss.Those who long to triumph over life’s distress,And who wish to put an end
to others’ sorrows,Those who seek to experience abundant joys—Let them never turn their backs
on bodhicitta.For the very instant that bodhicitta is bornIn the weary captives enslaved
within saṃsāra,They are called heirs of the bliss-gone buddhas,Honourable to gods, humans,
and the world.Like the alchemists’ supreme elixir,It takes this ordinary, impure human
form,And makes of it a buddha’s priceless body—Such is bodhicitta: let us grasp it firmly!With
their boundless wisdom, beings’ only guides,Have investigated thoroughly and seen its
value.Thus whoever longs for freedom from conditioned statesShould grasp this precious bodhicitta
and guard it well.All other virtues are like the plantain tree:They bear their fruit,
and then they are no more.Yet constantly the marvellous tree of bodhicittaYields fruit
and, undiminished, grows forevermore.Even those who’ve committed intolerable misdeeds,Through
having bodhicitta instantly are freed,Just like a brave companion banishing all one’s
fears—Why then would the prudent fail to put their trust in it?Just like a great inferno
at the ends of time,It annihilates terrible misdeeds in but an instant.Thus its benefits
are vast beyond all measuring,As the wise Lord Maitreya explained to Sudhana.Understand that,
briefly stated,Bodhicitta has two aspects:The mind aspiring to awaken,And bodhicitta
that’s enacted.Just as one understands the differenceBetween wishing to go and setting out
upon a journey,The wise should understand these two,Recognizing their difference and their
order.Bodhicitta in aspiration brings about great results,Even as we continue to circle
within saṃsāra;Yet it does not bring about a ceaseless stream of merit,For that will come
solely from active bodhicitta.From the moment we genuinely take upThis irreversible attitude—The
mind that aspires to liberate entirelyThe infinite realms of beings,From then on, even
while asleep,Or during moments of inattention,A plentiful, unceasing force of meritWill
arise, equal to the vastness of the sky.This was explained by the Buddha,Together with supporting
reasons,In a teaching given at Subāhu’s request,For the sake of those inclined to
lesser paths.If boundless merit comes to anyone who,With the intention to be of benefit,Has
the thought simply to relieve the painOf those afflicted merely with a headache,What need
is there to speak of the wishTo dispel all beings’ boundless sufferings,Or the longing
that they all might gainEnlightened qualities infinite in number.Do even our fathers or our
mothersHave such benevolence as this?Do the gods or the great sages?Does even mighty Brahmā?If
these beings have never beforeHeld this aspiration for their own sake—Not even in
their dreams—how couldThey have made this wish for others?A thought such as this—wanting for
othersWhat they do not wish for even for themselves—Is an extraordinary and precious state
of mind,And its occurrence a marvel unlike any other!This source of joy for all who wander
in existence,This elixir that heals the sufferings of all beings,This priceless jewel
within the mind—How could such merit ever be evaluated?For if the simple wish to benefit
othersSurpasses offerings made before the buddhas,What need is there to mention strivingFor
the welfare of all without exception?Although seeking to avoid pain,They run headlong into
suffering.They long for happiness, but foolishlyDestroy it, as if it were their enemy.To
satisfy with every kind of joy,And to cut through all the sufferingsOf those who lack any
real happiness,And are oppressed by sorrow’s burden,To bring an end as well to their delusion—What
other virtue is comparable to this?What friend is there who does as much?What else
is there which is as meritorious?If even those who do good deeds as repaymentFor past
favours are worthy of some praise,What need is there to mention the bodhisattvas,Whose perfect
actions are carried out unbidden?There are those who offer meals occasionally, and to
just a few;Their gifts, which are no more than food, are made in just a moment,And with disrespect,
to bring nourishment for merely half a day—And yet such people are honoured by
the world as virtuous.Yet how does this compare to those who giveOver many ages and to the
whole infinity of beings,Constantly offering them the fulfilment of their every wish:The
unsurpassable happiness born of blissful buddhahood?And those who develop feelings of hostilityTowards
these benefactors, the buddhas’ heirs,Will languish in the hells, the mighty
Sage has said,For aeons equal to the moments of their malice.By contrast, to look upon them
wellWill yield benefits in still greater measure.For even in adversity, the buddhas’ heirsBring
no harm, only virtue that naturally increases.I bow down before all those in whomThis
most precious, sacred mind is born!I take refuge in those great sources of joyWho bring
bliss even to those who harm them.

Bodhicaryāvatāra: An Introduction to the Bodhisattva’s Way of Life

by Śāntideva

Chapter II — Confession of Negativity

In order that I might adopt this precious jewel of mind,I now make the most excellent of offerings
to the buddhas,To the sacred Dharma—that most rare and flawless jewel—And to the buddhas’
heirs, whose qualities are limitless.I offer every variety of fruit and flower,And
every kind of healing medicine,Each and every jewel this world affords,And all its pure and
freshest waters,Every mountain filled with precious gems,And forest groves, isolated and
inspiring,Trees of paradise garlanded with blossom,And trees whose branches are laden with
fine fruit,Perfumed fragrances from the gods and other realms,Incense, trees that grant
wishes and produce magic gems,Spontaneous harvests grown without the tiller’s care,And every
thing of beauty worthy to be offered,Lakes and ponds adorned with lotus flowers,Where the
pleasant calls of geese are heard,Every thing and place of beauty unclaimed by any owner,Extending
to the boundless limits of space itself.I picture them all in my mind, and to
the supreme buddhasAnd their bodhisattva heirs, I make a perfect gift of them.Think of me
with love, O sublime and compassionate lords,And accept all these offerings which I now present.Lacking
stores of merit, I am destituteAnd have nothing more to offer.O protectors,
who consider only others’ benefit,In your great power, accept this for my sake.To the buddhas
and their bodhisattva heirs,I offer my body now and in all my lives to come.Supreme courageous
ones, accept me totally,For with devotion I will be your servant.If you accept me
and take me fully in your care,I will not fear saṃsāra as I offer other beings help.The harmful
acts I did before are entirely in the past,And from now on, I vow to do no further
deeds of harm.To a bath house filled with soothing scents,With brightly sparkling floors of
crystal,And fine pillars all shimmering with gems,Where hang gleaming canopies of pearls,I
invite the buddhas and their bodhisattva heirs.I request you: Come to bathe yourselves
in scented water,Poured from overflowing jugs made of exquisite jewels,All the while accompanied
by melody and song.Then let me dry you in cloths beyond compare,Immaculate and anointed
well with perfumed scent,And dress you finely in the most excellent of garments,Lightly
scented and dyed in vivid colours.I offer clothing made of the finest gentle fabrics,And
hundreds of the most beautiful adornments,To grace the bodies of noble Samantabhadra,Mañjughoṣa,
Lokeśvara and the rest.With the most sublime of fragrant perfumes,That gently permeates
throughout a billion worlds,I will anoint the bodies of all the buddhas,Gleaming brightly,
like pure and burnished gold.To the mighty sages, perfect recipients of my offering,I
will present red lotus and heavenly mandārava,Blue utpala flower and other scented blossoms,Beautifully
arranged in brightly coloured garlands.I also offer billowing clouds of
incense,Whose sweet aroma captivates the mind,And a rich feast of plentiful food and drink,Fit
to grace the tables of the gods.I offer row upon row of precious lamps,All perfectly
contrived as golden lotuses,And I scatter the petals of attractive flowersUpon level, incense-sprinkled
ground.I offer divine palaces resonant with songs of praise,Gleaming with precious
pearls and pendant gems,The most beautiful of structures in the whole of space—All
this I offer to those whose nature is compassion.Jewel-encrusted parasols with handles made
of gold,Whose fringes are all embellished in ornate designs,Turned upright, well proportioned
and pleasing to the eye.Now and forever, I offer this to all the buddhas.May a multitude
of other offerings,Accompanied by music sweet to hear,Be made in great successive clouds,To
soothe the pains of living beings.May rains of precious gems and flowersShower down
in never-ending streams,Upon all the jewels of noble Dharma,And sacred monuments and images.Just
as Mañjughoṣa and the restMade offerings to all the buddhas,Likewise I too will offer
to those thus goneAnd all their bodhisattva heirs.With vast oceans of melodious praise,I
honour these oceans of good qualities.May clouds of sweet and gentle praiseAscend unceasingly
before them.Multiplying my body as many times as there are atomsIn the universe, I
prostrate and bow beforeThe buddhas of the past, present and future,The Dharma and the supreme
assembly.To all supports of bodhicittaAnd all stūpas, I bow down,And to preceptors and
teachers,And those who practise discipline.Until I realize the essence of enlightenment,I
take refuge in the buddhas.And likewise in the Dharma,And the assembly of bodhisattvas.To
the perfect buddhas and bodhisattvas,Who reside in every direction of space,And who embody
great compassion,I press my palms together and pray:In this and all my other countless
lifetimesSpent wandering in beginningless saṃsāra,In my ignorance I have committed wrongsAnd
encouraged others to do the same.Overwhelmed by ignorant delusion,I celebrated the harm
that was done.But now I see it all was done in error,And before the buddhas, sincerely I
confess.Whatever I have done against the Three Jewels,My parents, my teachers or anyone else,Through
the force of my afflictions,With my body, speech or mind,All the misdeeds that
I, the wicked one, have done,Faults that cling to me from my many mistakes,And all the unbearable
crimes I have committed,I openly declare to you, the guides of all the world.Before
my negativity has been purified,My life may well come to an end,So I pray now: grant me
your protection,Swiftly, to ensure that I am freed!The Lord of Death is fickle, unworthy of
our trust,Whether life’s tasks are done or not, he will not wait.For the sick and for the
healthy alike,This fleeting life is not something on which we can rely.When we go, we must
leave everything behind,But I have failed to understand this, and soFor the sake of friends
and enemies alike,I engaged in all manner of harmful deeds.My enemies will become no
more,And my friends will cease to be,I myself will pass from this existence,And everything
in turn will disappear.Like experiences in a dream,Everything I make use of and enjoy,Will
later turn to faded memory,And having passed will not be seen again.In this lifetime, which
lasts but for a while,Some friends and enemies are now gone.But not the harmful acts I
did for them—Those unbearable effects are still to come.Never thinking that I tooMight quickly
pass away,In my delusion, lust and hatred,I have done so much to harm.Never halting,
day or night,My life is always slipping by.Having gone, life can not be extended,So how could
the likes of me not die?While I lie there in my final bed,Friends and family may be by
my side,But I alone will be the oneTo feel the severing of all ties to life.When I am seized
by the emissaries of Death,What help will be my family or my friends?At that time it
is merit alone that can protect me,But upon that, alas, I have failed to depend.O protectors!
I was heedless,Unaware of horrors such as this,And all for this transient existence,Amassed
so many harmful deeds.When led towards the place of torture,Where his body will soon
be ripped apart,A man is transfigured by his terror;His mouth turns dry, his pained eyes
dart.If that is so, then how desperate will I be,When stricken down and gravely ill with fear,I
am seized by the messengers of Death,And their gruesome, terrifying forms appear?Is
there anyone who can really save meFrom the horrors of this appalling fate?Staring in terror
with my eyes opened wide,I’ll search all around to find a refuge place.When nowhere do
I see such a place of safety,My heart will sink; depressed, I’ll give up hope.For if there
is no haven to which I might retreat,What options am I left with? What is there to do?Thus,
from this day onwards I take refugeIn the buddhas, the guardians of the world,Who labour
to protect and benefit us all,And whose great strength can banish every fear.Likewise, I
genuinely take refugeIn the Dharma they have realized,Which eliminates saṃsāra’s terror,And
also in the hosts of bodhisattvas.Utterly terrified and gripped with fear,I give myself
to Samantabhadra;And to Mañjughoṣa too,I offer this body in service.To the protector Avalokiteśvara,Whose
compassion is in all his actions,I cry out in the depths of desperation,“Grant
me your protection, evil as I am!”To the noble bodhisattvasĀkāśagarbha and Kṣitigarbha,And
all the lords of great compassion,From my heart, I call for your protection.And I take
refuge in Vajrapāṇi,Before whom Death’s messengersAnd all who threaten us will fleeIn
terror, dispersed in all directions.In the past I ignored your words,But now I have seen this
horror,And so I take you as my refuge:Swiftly banish all my fears, I pray!For if, alarmed
by common ailments,I must follow the doctor’s sage advice,How much more so when perpetuallyAfflicted
by desire and other faults.If one of these alone brings ruinTo all who dwell
within the world,And no other cure to heal themIs found anywhere at all,Then the intention
not to followThe advice of the omniscient physician,Whose words banish ills of every kind,Is
utter madness, worthy of contempt.If I need to take special care when poisedAbove a
common drop of some small height,Then how much more so to avoid the oneOf deep duration that
falls a thousand miles?It makes no sense to relax and think:“Today, at least, I shall not
die,”For it is certain that a time will comeWhen my life will cease to be.Who can offer
me reassurance?How can I be sure I need not fear?If there is no doubt that I will die,Then
how can I remain at ease?Of my experiences from the past,What’s left for me? What now remains?Yet
by clinging to them obsessively,I have disobeyed my teacher’s words.Just as I must
eventually forsake this life,So too must I take leave of relatives and friends.When I must
go alone on death’s uncertain journey,What concern to me are all these enemies and allies?How
can I free myself from non-virtue,The source from which sufferings arise?At all times
of the day and night,This should be my one concern.Whatever wrongs I have committed,In
my ignorance and blindness—Whether actions plainly negativeOr deeds proscribed by vows,Before
the buddhas, I join my palms together,And, terrified by the awful sufferings to come,Prostrate
myself upon the ground over and again,Confessing all my harmful deeds, each and
every one.I call upon you, the guides of all the world,To accept me, and the harms that I
have done.And these actions, since they are unwholesome,I promise, from now on, I shall never
do again.
